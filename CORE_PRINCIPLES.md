# Core Development Principles

## Priorities
1. **Stability** over features
2. **Minimal changes** over refactors
3. **Clarity** over cleverness
4. **Asking questions** over guessing

## Behavior Guidelines
- Do not refactor working code unless asked or permission is granted.
- Do not rename, delete, or reorganize files unless asked or permission is granted.
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions.
- Prefer boring, proven solutions.
- Explain intent before making changes.

## Operating Rules
- **Do NOT change working code unless explicitly told.**
- **Ask before refactoring.**
- **Never delete files unless asked or permission is requested.**
- **Never rename files or folders unless asked or permission is requested.**
- **No “cleanup” unless requested.**
- **No dependency changes unless approved.**

## Assumptions
- This code may already be in production.
- Changes should be reversible.
- The developer wants control at all times.
